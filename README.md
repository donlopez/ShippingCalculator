# ShippingCalculator

This project is a shipping calculator implemented in C++. It calculates the price based on the weight and distance of the package. The calculator consists of several functions that handle different aspects of the calculation.

## How it works

The main function accepts the distance in miles and calls three other functions to calculate the weight in three segments. These functions are responsible for determining the weight based on the package's characteristics.

## Skills learned

During the development of this project, the following skills were learned:

- Creating customized functions to handle specific tasks.
- Calling functions in the main body with appropriate variables.

Feel free to explore the code and make any necessary modifications to suit your needs.
